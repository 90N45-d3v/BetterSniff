# BetterSniff
With this script you can host an access point with [create_ap](https://github.com/oblique/create_ap) and sniff all traffic with [Bettercap](https://www.bettercap.org/) automatically
or if you are connected to an existing network and want to sniff some traffic there, you can do that too.

# Features
- Sniff domains your victim is visiting (full path location if request is http)
- Inject customizable javascript into every http website
- probe-request scanner (only rogue AP mode)
- ARP-spoofing for beeing the mitm (only client mode)

# Install
For me it works like a charm on kali (all needed tools are preinstalled), if you want try running it on another linux distro, you maybe need to install some additional dependencies.
